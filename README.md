# DNA_methylation_prediction

Welcome to the 'DNA_methylation_prediction' repository!

Event: Kaggle competition for the course Predictive Modeling <br />
Participant: All MSc Bioinformatics Students of the Ghent University <br />

The addition of a methyl group to CG dinucleotides is called CpG methylation.
It is known as a driving factor in for example developmental biology and tumorigenesis.
In order to understand this phenomenon better, researchers have tried to extract DNA sequence motifs (patterns) related to aberrant DNA methylation.
Machine learning models are interesting in this use-case because of their ability to automatically identify the relevant patterns.
The goal of this competition is to predict a binary label (methylated or not methylated) for human methylation sites based on their surrounding DNA.
